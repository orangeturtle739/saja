\section{Proposal}
\subsection{Vision}
SAJA is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging system designed for communication between people on the same network.

\subsection{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item UDP based discovery of other connected users on the same network
	\item End-to-end encrypted messaging
	\item Group messaging
	\item Setting a username
	\item Exporting a chat log to a file
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description}
A sample user starts the program and has the ability to send out a UDP broadcast to discover other online users on the same network using the \texttt{:discover} command. This lists the IP addresses, user names, and public keys of these connected users. Alternatively, the user can manually send keys by using the \texttt{:transmit} command and process received keys from others using the \texttt{:process} command.\\

The user can choose to message any number of users that they know the details of, creating a group messaging session. The other users in this newly formed group receive a notification, inviting them to join the conversation. Once they do so, they will be able to send messages to everyone else who has agreed to join the group. If a user logs off and then logs back into a session, the client will request all of its peers for a history of what has happened during the logged-off period.\\

All messages sent using this system are encrypted and signed using a hybrid cryptosystem of RSA and AES. Every user maintains a keychain mapping usernames to public RSA keys. Every time a user starts a chat, the program verifies that the public key and username pair advertised with the chat matches that stored in the user's local keychain (this is a very simplified version of the PGP trust model). Group messages are represented as a grouping of pairwise messaging connections. Upon receiving a message, all clients verify the signature.

\subsection{Sample Session}
\begin{lstlisting}

\subsection{System Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Console}: wrapper over STDIN, STDOUT

	\item \textbf{Keychain Persistence}: stores mapping of usernames to public keys in memory and formats for writing to a file
	\item \textbf{Message Persistence}: lets user write chat log to file
	\item \textbf{Persistence}: a general wrapper for writing data structures to files
	\item \textbf{Crypto}: handles encryption, decryption, and verification

\end{figure}
\subsection{Data}

The data our system maintains is a keychain mapping between username strings and public keys. This keychain stores your own private key, so it is encrypted before being written to disk. The message persistence module maintains a store of the messages sent and received during the current session. We use JSON to store this data. We use the OCaml standard library \texttt{Map} for our keychain and message persistence.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\textbf{OPAM packages}. These are also found in  \texttt{packages.txt} in the root directory. Running \texttt{make install} in the top-level directory will install all of them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item async
    \item async-extra
    \item cryptokit
    \item ctypes
    \item ctypes-foreign
    \item scrypt
\end{itemize}

\textbf{External dependencies}. We recommend downloading these on an Ubuntu system (like the VM) using \textit{apt-get}.

\begin{itemize}
 \item tmux
 \item libssl
 \item libffi-dev
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Plan}
We tested regularly using an interactive testing strategy, meeting regularly to test one-on-one and multi-user chats. We also wrote unit tests for cryptography.

\section{Protocol}

\subsection{Discovery}

If the usernames are not in the local key store, the program will emit a UDP broadcast to acquire unknown public keys. It will then prompt the user to validate the key fingerprints of the received keys. If the user validates the fingerprints, it will store them permanently in the key store for future use.

\subsection{Initiation}
When a user wishes to start a chat, they will enter the usernames of the people they wish to chat with. The initiator will then send a message to each of the other members of the group containing a unique session ID (different for each member) and a list of all other members in the chat.\\

\subsection{Message Transport}
Message transport will be done pairwise, with each client sending a message individually to each other member of the group. Each chat has a session ID associated with it. The session id is set at initialization, and upon receiving the initialization message, each client hashes the sesssion ID to use as the session ID for the chat.\\

When a client responds to the message, they will include this hashed session ID. This prevents the client from signing an arbitrary session ID. Without this hashing procedure, Eve could send a malicious initialization message to Alice containing a session ID containing something Alice would not want to sign, but she would sign anyways and send back. By hashing the session ID, it becomes computationally infeasible for Eve to generate a session ID such that when hashed would be malicious.

\subsection{Encryption}
We used a hybrid-encryption scheme using 4096-bit RSA and 256-bit AES. RSA will be used to encrypt a session key for each message, and the body of the message will be encrypted using AES with that session key. The AES will use cipher block chaining.\\

\subsection{Key Verification}
In order for the cryptosystem to be secure, each client must verify the keys of each user they communicate with over some secure channel, preferably in person. The program provides a \texttt{:fingerprint} command which prints out the public key fingerprint of the current user. The fingerprint is generated using a SHA-512 hash of the public encryption and signing keys.\\

A user can transmit their key to any other user by broadcasting it over UDP using \texttt{:discover} or directly with \texttt{:transmit <username | IP>}. Upon receiving a key, a user can add it to their keychain with \texttt{:process} (\texttt{:discover} will automatically invoke \texttt{:process} on any keys it receives; \texttt{:process} is only necessary when \texttt{:transmit} is used).\\

If there is no entry for the username in the keychain, the program will prompt the user to verify the fingerprint. If the key is already in the keychain and matches the one received, then the program will inform the user that it discovered a peer. If the user discovered is already stored in the keychain, but the key stored in the keychain does not match the key received, the program prints out a warning advising the user to reject the key because they user is probably the target of a man in the middle attack.

\subsection{Integrity}

Each encrypted message is hashed with SHA-512 and then signed using a separate signing RSA key.

\subsection{Attack Analysis}
To asses the security of the system, we condsidered the following attacks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a man in the middle attack. Alice and Bob are trying to send messages to each other, but Eve pretends to be Bob, sending Bob's public keys to Alice from her own IP address. However, because Alice has verified Bob's key fingerprint in person, no matter where Alice sends her encrypted messages, a MITM attack will not allow Eve to decrypt the message because Alice won't encrypt the message with any key not equal to the verified key she has stored in her keychain.
\item Consider a signing or encryption oracle attack. However, since each message only consists of the message the user wrote and a session ID, an attacker cannot force a client to encrypt and sign arbitrary data. With respect to the session ID, since each client hashes it on receiving it and uses the hashed version for all future communication, it is infeasible for an attack to engineer a session ID such that when hashed is something usefull.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Division of Labor}

All four team members collaborated on the main controller module in \textit{saja.ml} and fixed bugs that came up.


\begin{itemize}

        \item Siddant: Worked on TCP module. Implemented helper functions for formatting and printing.\\

        \item Alex: Developed persistence module and related portions of the controller.\\

        \item Jacob: Implemented cryptography module, worked on UDP module, created message transport protocol, used tmux to display chat and prompt in separate windows. \\

        \item Amit: Worked on UDP module, defined and implemented frontend user experience. \\

\end{itemize}

\section{Build Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install dependencies if needed.
    \item Run \texttt{make run} in the top-level directory.
\end{enumerate}

Note: Running \texttt{make debug} will run the version without tmux.

\section{Compatibility Issues}

Due to issues with Jane Street's UDP library, the broadcast function does not work with Mac OS X, so the \texttt{:discovery} command will not work on a Mac.
